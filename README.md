Hi. I'm Mingyu Kwak.

- I'm currently...
  - looking for my first job.
  - interested in TypeScript, Next.js, React, and tailwindCSS.
  - have no hesitation in taking new features and APIs.
 
- Recently...
  - trying to understand the way the tools I use work.
  - excited because of the first user event in my service, [hufchichi](https://github.com/hufs-sports-live/client).
